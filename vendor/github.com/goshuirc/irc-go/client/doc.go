/*
Package gircclient is an IRC client library.

It uses the other various gIRC-Go libraries to provide a clean, consistent
interface for connecting to and interacting with IRC servers.

The Reactor is the primary handler of all new clients.

This package is in planning/pre-alpha and the API will change substantially.
