Package goshuirc has useful, self-contained packages that help with IRC
development. These packages are split up so you can easily choose which ones to
use while ignoring the others, handling things like simplifying formatting
codes, parsing and creating raw IRC lines, and event management.

An example bot that uses these packages can be found here:
https://gist.github.com/DanielOaks/cbbc957e8dba39f59d9e

These packages are in their early stages. For the status of each package, see
the documentation for that package.
